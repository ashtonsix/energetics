        General systems theory is at the heart of emerging practice in business
        and civil service (Wardley Mapping, Cynefin, Sensemaking, Toyota
        Production System). Today, the field has immense potential value to any
        problem-solver tackling complexity, problems where many elements
        interlock. General systems theory can help! Whether it weather, protein
        folding, deep learning, immunology, epidemiology, social network
        analysis (tracking the spread of misinformation), historical analysis
        (causes of the bronze age collapse, impact of the republic of letters),
        corporate prosecution (establishing culpability where the impact of
        malfeasance is dificult to measure), ecological intervention (predicting
        the impact of introducing certain species to a new biome), or almost any
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say useful things across so many areas requires shared technical
        language. We cannot, for example, measure the cultural impact of Gertude
        Stein's Tender Buttons in farenheit or the second derivative of position
        with respect to time (unless, of course, we're talking about position
        within an abstract phase space; or, to translate, position within a
        zeitgeist's ontogenetic landscape). This is where concepts like energy,
        disorder, information and signal shine. So long as they are defined in
        suffciently general terms they can parametise a great range of systems:
        the flow of nutrients through an ecosystem, of money through an economy,
        of memes through a social group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today these concepts, energy and such, are largely enmeshed in the laws
        of thermodynamics, and it's my belief that these laws are entirely
        unsuitable as the foundation for general systems theory. A suitable
        foundation requires, to, for example, understand how life arises from
        inert chemicals and societies arise from disconnected individuals, a
        theory of statistical cause that generalises over
        {/* The foundation
        for general systems theory requires consensus across fields, it's
        principles should have buy-in from physicicists, sociologists,
        biologists and every disicipline. */}
        {/* Let's look at how my research can help unleash the full potential of
        general systems theory. First of all, let's realise that concepts like
        energy and disorder are deeply enmeshed with the laws of thermodynamics,
        and its axioms, such as “every action causes an increase in disorder”,
        don't readily apply to most systems. */}
      </p>
      <p>
        On the physics side of things. Why did Einstein think velocity relative
        but acceleration absolute? Why are the most powerful magnets in the
        universe (neutron stars) electromagnetically neutral? (magnetism has far
        less to do with what material something is made of, and far more to do
        with whether it's elements are free to rotate; neutrons cannot freely
        rotate in the context of an atomic nuclei, but they can in the context
        of a neutron star) Since galaxies are so isolated from each other,
        shouldn't they be in quantum superpositions relative to each other?.
        Velocity is always <Tex>{`=1`}</Tex>, time and distance are the same
        thing, charge and (quark) color don't exist. Quantum computers can
        reduce the computational complexity of any program by{' '}

        how a rocket gets into space. Which, for completeness, must include an
        explanation for how the rocket was procured. Who built the rocket? Who
        trained them? Where did the funding come from? What political and
        economic climate made that funding possible? The number of intermodal
        causal links here is mind-boggling, how do we make sense of this? Even
        unimodal causality can be tough to figure out. */}
      {/* Yikes. How do
        we make sense of all this? The first thing we need to describe these
        intermodal causal links is a common language, with which we can say
        useful things no matter the field in which we're working. 
        And so, this is where we turn to concepts like constraints,
        propensities, complexity, disorder, information and signal: properties
        everything has be they vegetable, animal, mineral, or the very model of
        a modern major-general. And the field that studies them: general systems
        theory. */}

        Originating in the 1960s from the fields of thermodynamics, meteorology
        and ecology, general systems theory is an area of active research today,
        and sees practical application across
        {/* General systems theory already benefits a lot of people today. Emerging
        practices like Wardley Mapping, Cynefin, and the Toyota manufacturing

        possible, meaning we should be able to start making low-latency phone
        calls to Mars sometime within the next 100 years. The quantum internet
        we have today reads 1 bit-at-a-time, which destabilises the connections
        between entangled particles, and makes FTL impossible. By reading{' '}
        <Tex>{`\\le`}</Tex> 0.015 bits-at-a-time, reading the same bit
        repeatedly and doing error correction, I believe one should be able to
        transmit an immediately-readable signal FTL without destabilizing the
        connection between the entangled particles. I intend to explain why I
        believe this should work in an upcoming essay. With 2200 redundant reads
        per bit one should be able to send 100GB of data across the wire with
        99.7% confidence the received message has no errors (

        What I have shown so far is of great relevance to the hypothetical
        biengs around infinity years from now, but frankly, is of little
        relevance to anyone alive today. Fortunately, I have far more to offer
        than has been shown so far. On my quest to protect the lives of our
        distant children I have discovered new physics, new philosophy, and new
        ways to expand general systems theory. All of these discoveries will
        bring joy and benefit to many in my lifetime (and beyond).

        a long and arduous one. And finding the compelling-enough words required
        to share one's discoveries in the proper fashion can be just as
        challenging. I'm not yet ready to share the things I've learned in their
